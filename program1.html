	<h2> What are Protien foods?</h2>
	<p> All foods made from seafood; meat, poultry, and eggs; beans, peas, and lentils; and nuts, seeds,
		and soy products are part of the Protein Foods Group. Select a wide variety of protein foods to get more of the nutrients your body needs and for health benefits. Meat and poultry choices should be lean or low-fat, like 93% lean ground beef, pork loin, and skinless chicken breasts. Choose seafood options that are higher in beneficial fatty acids (omega-3s) and lower in methylmercury, such as salmon, anchovies, and trout. The advice to consume lean or low-fat meat and poultry and a variety of seafood does not apply to vegetarians. Vegetarian options in the Protein Foods Group include beans, peas, and lentils, nuts, seeds, and soy products. </p>

	<h2> Boiled foods better?</h2>
	<p> Boiled vegetables are easy to digest, and they help prevent acidity and inflammation. Boiling foods help convert complex food compounds into simpler compounds â€“ making them easier to digest. This also results in less acid production during the process of digestion. Thus boiled chicken or eggs will have more protien than carbs than friying them will give you.</p>
